# Netflix TV Shows and Movie Clustering

# Overview
This project focuses on clustering Netflix TV shows and movies based on their content attributes to facilitate content recommendation and classification. Netflix offers a vast library of TV shows and movies, and organizing them into meaningful clusters can help improve content discovery and user engagement. By leveraging clustering algorithms, this project aims to group similar titles together based on features such as genre, duration, release year, and viewer ratings.

# Motivation
As the amount of content available on streaming platforms like Netflix continues to grow, users face challenges in discovering relevant titles. Clustering Netflix TV shows and movies based on their content attributes can provide users with more personalized recommendations and enhance their overall viewing experience.

# Data
The dataset used in this project consists of metadata and features extracted from Netflix TV shows and movies, including genre, duration, release year, viewer ratings, and possibly textual descriptions. This data is utilized to train clustering models and group similar titles together.

# Methodology
Various clustering algorithms, such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, are employed to group Netflix TV shows and movies into clusters based on their content attributes. The choice of clustering algorithm and the number of clusters are determined through experimentation and evaluation of clustering performance.

# Results
The clustering models developed in this project demonstrate the ability to group Netflix TV shows and movies into meaningful clusters based on their content attributes. Evaluation results and insights into cluster characteristics are provided in the project's documentation.

# Contributing
Contributions to this project, such as additional feature engineering, experimentation with different clustering algorithms, or improvements in clustering performance, are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your suggestions or enhancements.
